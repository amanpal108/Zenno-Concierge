You are tasked with building a complete MVP application called "Zenno Concierge" based on the detailed specifications provided. This is a complex full-stack application that integrates multiple real APIs and services.

{{PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS}}
</project_requirements>

You must build this application exactly as specified in the PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS above. This is a sophisticated AI concierge system that helps users in India find and purchase Banarasi sarees through an end-to-end automated process involving real API integrations.

## Key Implementation Requirements:

**Critical Constraints:**
- All Locus wallet transactions must be REAL using the provided API key and wallet ID
- All Twilio phone calls must be REAL outbound calls to the specified vendor number
- All Stripe payments must use the REAL test API (test mode but actual API calls)
- Anthropic Agent SDK must be used for all AI reasoning and orchestration
- ElevenLabs must be used for English text-to-speech generation
- Only Google Places results may be mocked if the Maps API key is missing
- The application must fail fast at startup if any mandatory API keys are missing

**Architecture Overview:**
- Backend: Python + FastAPI with proper CORS configuration
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS  
- AI Agent: Anthropic Agent SDK for reasoning and orchestration
- Voice: ElevenLabs TTS for English responses to users
- Telephony: Twilio for real outbound calls with Hindi negotiation
- Payments: Locus (real USDC transactions) → Stripe (real test mode payouts)
- Maps: Google Places API (with fallback mock data)

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Project Structure**: Create the exact folder structure specified, including all routes, services, and components.

2. **Configuration**: Implement config.py with proper environment variable validation and fail-fast behavior for missing mandatory keys.

3. **Backend Services**: Implement each service module exactly as specified:
   - zenno_agent.py: Anthropic Agent SDK integration
   - elevenlabs_tts.py: Real ElevenLabs API calls
   - twilio_client.py: Real Twilio outbound calling
   - locus_wallet.py: Real USDC transactions on Base
   - stripe_payments.py: Real Stripe test API payouts
   - google_places.py: Places API with mock fallback

4. **API Routes**: Implement all specified routes with proper request/response models:
   - /api/chat: User conversation handling
   - /api/vendors/*: Vendor search and selection
   - /api/calls/*: Twilio call management and webhooks
   - /api/payments/*: Payment processing
   - /api/tts/*: Text-to-speech generation

5. **Frontend Implementation**: Build React components with proper state management for the complete user flow from initial chat through payment completion.

6. **Integration Flow**: Ensure the complete end-to-end flow works:
   - User chats with Zenno in English
   - Zenno finds vendors and gets user selection
   - Zenno makes real Twilio call and negotiates in Hindi
   - Zenno processes real Locus USDC payment
   - Zenno creates real Stripe test payout
   - User receives complete summary with transaction details

**Error Handling:**
- Implement proper error handling for all API integrations
- Provide clear error messages when real API calls fail
- Do not mock or simulate failures - let real API errors propagate appropriately

**Output Requirements:**
Provide the complete, working codebase including:
- All backend Python files with proper imports and error handling
- All frontend React/TypeScript components
- Configuration files (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)
- README.md with setup instructions and environment variable documentation
- Proper project structure as specified

The application must be production-ready code that can be deployed and run successfully when provided with valid API keys for all the required services.

Remember: This is not a demo or prototype - it must make real API calls to Locus, Twilio, Stripe, Anthropic, and ElevenLabs as specified. Only Google Places may be mocked if the API key is unavailable.
